applied changed (see patch.diff) for fixing compilation issues:

	line 254: size_t convert to int on calls to details::to_str,
			  added sizt_t overload for to_str (unsigned only).

	line 17727: register_symbol_table does not modify the table, changed to const, so i can be called from const function(s).
